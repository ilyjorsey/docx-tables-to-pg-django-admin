# Algorithm for Uploading Data from DOCX Tables to Database via Django Admin

This algorithm allows you to upload data from DOCX tables directly into a database through the Django admin panel. The core of the functionality is based on the `DocxToDB` class, which handles the conversion of DOCX tables to CSV and imports the data into a specified model.

### How It Works

1. **File Upload in Admin Panel**: 
   You can drag and drop a DOCX file into the Django admin panel. The file is then processed, and the data is extracted from the tables in the DOCX file.
   
2. **Conversion of DOCX Data**:
   The `DocxToDB` class is responsible for converting DOCX tables into CSV format. Afterward, the CSV file is parsed, and the data is imported into the PostgreSQL database.

3. **Custom Implementation**:
   A subclass of `DocxToDB`, called `ImportDocument402n`, is implemented to handle specific adjustments for a given use case, such as field mappings and other custom parsing logic. This class demonstrates how you can extend the core functionality for specific needs.

4. **Why CSV?**:
   In this case, CSV is used for data handling instead of using `DataFrame`, as the files being processed are small, and CSV provides a simple and efficient method for parsing and importing data.
